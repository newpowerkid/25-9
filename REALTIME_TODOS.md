# Real-time Todo List with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

This implementation adds real-time functionality to the TodoListCard using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Todos are automatically updated across all connected clients when changes are made
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator showing SSE connection status
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatically reconnects if the connection is lost
- **User-specific**: Each user only receives updates for their own todos

## How it Works

### Backend (API)
- **SSE Endpoint**: `/api/todos/sse` - Establishes a persistent connection for real-time updates
- **Broadcasting**: All CRUD operations (create, update, delete) broadcast changes to connected clients
- **Connection Management**: Tracks active connections per user and cleans up disconnected clients

### Frontend (React)
- **useTodosSSE Hook**: Custom hook that manages the SSE connection
- **React Query Integration**: Automatically updates the cache when SSE messages are received
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows connection status with WiFi icons

## Technical Implementation

### SSE Endpoint
```typescript
// GET /api/todos/sse
// Establishes SSE connection and broadcasts todo updates
```

### Client Hook
```typescript
const { isConnected, error } = useTodosSSE(!!hasSession)
```

### Real-time Events
- `connected`: Initial connection established
- `todos_updated`: Todo list has been modified (includes full updated list)

## Usage

1. **Login**: Users must be authenticated to use real-time features
2. **Automatic Connection**: SSE connection is established automatically when logged in
3. **Real-time Updates**: Any changes to todos (add, edit, delete) are immediately reflected across all connected clients
4. **Connection Status**: The UI shows whether real-time updates are active

## Browser Support

SSE is supported in all modern browsers. The implementation includes:
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Error handling and user feedback
- Clean connection cleanup on component unmount

## Testing

To test the real-time functionality:
1. Open the app in multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Login with the same account
3. Add, edit, or delete todos in one tab
4. Observe real-time updates in other tabs
